Embedding vectors capture semantic meaning of text.
Latency spikes often signal provider mis-selection.
Short sentence.
Another short line.
Yet another compact phrase.
This is a medium length sentence for batching behavior observation.
Provider routing should favor CPU for small batches.
Provider routing should favor alternative provider for large batches.
Different wording tests robustness of hashing.
Hash drift must not occur unless weights or tokenizer change.
Deterministic outputs enable confident refactors.
Performance predictability beats raw speed in many practical systems.
Streaming is not yet benchmarked but will be later.
Lowercase tokenization heuristic may miscount edge-cases.
CamelCaseIdentifiersShouldStillSplitReasonably maybe not.
Numbers 123 456 789 included here.
Symbols !@#$%^&*() and punctuation, commas, periods.
A longer paragraph style input begins here and continues with additional tokens to simulate realistic embedding loads for latency distribution measurement under moderate batch conditions.
Second paragraph like text to simulate variation and test caching strategies in the future phases of the project.
Edge     spacing   should     collapse logically.
Tabs	should	not	derail	tokenization.
