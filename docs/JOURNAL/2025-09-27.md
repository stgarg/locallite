## Focus
Kickoff of memory system + task structuring. Established tech stack baseline (Python + ONNX). Planned model backend abstraction.

## Notable Actions
- Created PURPOSE, GUIDING_PRINCIPLES, TASKS, BLOG_PIPELINE, OPEN_QUESTIONS.
- Identified first 3–4 blog candidates.
- Defined decision template & layering model for memory.
- Archived legacy main_old.py; added DEPRECATIONS.md.
- Added model registry + embedding backend abstractions (onnx + fastembed stub).
- Added benchmark harness draft + inputs + BENCHMARKS.md placeholder.

## Insights
- Memory scaffolding reduces friction for future blog writing.
- Need deterministic embedding harness early to avoid drift once multiple backends land.

## Next
- Archive legacy code.
- Start model registry skeleton.

## Mood / Meta
Clear direction; avoid scope creep before baseline benchmarks exist.
