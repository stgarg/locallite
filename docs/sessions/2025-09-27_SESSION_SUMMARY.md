# Session Summary – 2025-09-27

## 1. Intent of Session
Kick off a structured transformation from an exploratory local AI gateway into a disciplined, modular platform ("LocalLite") emphasizing:
- Learning how to build a high-quality SDK + gateway
- Establishing repeatable decision & memory hygiene
- Preparing narrative assets for future blog posts

## 2. Key Decisions & Artifacts Created
| Area | Decision / Artifact | Purpose |
|------|---------------------|---------|
| Tech Stack | `TECH_STACK_DECISION_LOG.md` | Canonical reasoning: Python + ONNX baseline, defer Rust/C# |
| Memory System | PURPOSE, GUIDING_PRINCIPLES, OPEN_QUESTIONS, TASKS, BLOG_PIPELINE, JOURNAL | Layered project memory (Canon / Active / Ephemeral) |
| Deprecations | `DEPRECATIONS.md` + archived `main_old.py` | Traceable evolution / reduce cognitive clutter |
| Runtime Modularity | `runtime/model_registry.py`, backends (onnx + fastembed), protocol | Foundation for multi-backend embeddings |
| Benchmarking | `embedding_benchmark.py`, inputs, BENCHMARKS placeholder | Drift detection & baseline performance harness |
| Blog Pipeline | 4 candidate posts in BLOG_PIPELINE | Feed writing output from implementation stream |
| Session Journal | `JOURNAL/2025-09-27.md` | Micro-log of progress |

## 3. Actions Completed (Chronological)
1. Read core readmes & design docs; mapped current architecture.
2. Defined Phase 0 objectives (cleanup + memory + registry scaffolding).
3. Authored tech stack decision (Python + ONNX; modular backends; archive C# later).
4. Built memory scaffolding (purpose, principles, tasks, open questions, blog pipeline, journal) + decision template.
5. Archived legacy `main_old.py`; logged in `DEPRECATIONS.md`.
6. Implemented model registry skeleton and embedding backend abstractions (`OnnxEmbeddingBackend`, `FastEmbedBackend`).
7. Created benchmark harness + deterministic embedding digest policy.
8. Populated initial tasks / epics and updated statuses.

## 4. Current State Snapshot
| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Active API | Still using existing `main.py` (registry not yet wired) |
| Embedding Backend | ONNX custom engine wrapped; fastembed adapter stub present |
| Chat Backend | Legacy path; unrefactored into new runtime yet |
| Benchmarks | Harness ready; baselines not yet recorded |
| Tokenization | Still heuristic (split); HF integration pending decision |
| Docs Hygiene | Memory layers established; many historic learnings remain uncurated |

## 5. Open Questions (From OPEN_QUESTIONS.md)
- LLM backend strategy (ONNX vs llama.cpp introduction timing)
- Canonical tokenization approach
- Document pipeline storage backing (FAISS+SQLite vs DuckDB)
- Early embedding cache vs wait
- Include reranker in MVP retrieval?

## 6. Risks / Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Token drift across backends | Add HF tokenizer + deterministic test early |
| Scope creep into doc pipeline too soon | Enforce Phase boundaries; update CURRENT_FOCUS weekly |
| Performance regression after modularization | Capture baseline before refactor wiring |
| Uncurated historical docs causing confusion | Create CURATION_PASS task: consolidate into curated INDEX + archive raw |

## 7. Next Session Priorities
| Priority | Task IDs | Outcome |
|----------|----------|---------|
| High | T1, T3 (archive C# + finalize deprecations) | Remove legacy ambiguity |
| High | T4–T6 (registry integration in API) | `/v1/models` served dynamically |
| High | T7–T10 (baseline benchmarks) | Populate BENCHMARKS.md with pre-refactor metrics |
| Medium | Tokenizer decision draft (create DECISION file) | Green light deterministic usage counts |
| Medium | Begin CURATION_PASS (select 5 high-signal learning docs) | Reduce noise |

## 8. Proposed Root Folder Reorganization (Deferred Execution)
| Item | Action | Benefit |
|------|--------|---------|
| `EmbeddingServer/` | Move to `archive/EmbeddingServer/` with README pointer | Simplifies active surface |
| `DocumentProcessor/` (if unused now) | Either integrate or archive temporarily | Reduces mental overhead |
| `scripts/` | Partition into `scripts/models/`, `scripts/dev/`, `scripts/bench/` | Discoverability |
| Root README | Clarify naming: Project name vs external `fastembed` lib | Avoid confusion |
| `fastembed-sdk/` | Rename to `sdk/` later (optional) | Neutral naming |
| Add `tools/` | For internal maintenance scripts (index generation, benchmarking) | Separation from user scripts |

## 9. Blog Post Draft Seeds (High-Level)
See BLOG_PIPELINE for IDs; outlines prepared separately (BL1–BL3; BL4 pending metrics).

## 10. Metrics To Capture Next
- Embedding mean + stdev (batch size = full benchmark set) for `onnx-custom`
- Digest baseline hash for `bge-small-en-v1.5`
- Memory footprint at load (RSS) — manual note first

## 11. Summary
Foundation laid for systematic evolution: memory hygiene, modular runtime scaffolding, deprecation discipline, and performance instrumentation. Next focus: baselining + wiring the registry into the live API before deeper refactors.
