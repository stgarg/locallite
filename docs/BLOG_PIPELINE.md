## OUTLINE DRAFTS
### BL3 (Project Memory System)
TL;DR: Borrow disciplined knowledge management (decision logs, layered memory) to eliminate context restart tax.
Problem: Solo projects silently rot; memory diffuses.
Approach: Layered docs: Canon, Active, Ephemeral, Retrieval.
Implementation: Files + automation hooks.
Lessons: Reduced rework, faster blog creation.
Next: Embed-based semantic search.
