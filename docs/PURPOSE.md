# PURPOSE

Primary Objective: Learn—by building—a high-quality local AI gateway + Python SDK (OpenAI-compatible) and distill the journey into publishable technical blog posts.

Scope (Current):
- Text embeddings + small-chat models (Phi-3, Gemma, Llama small)
- Baseline document ingestion planning
- NPU/CPU provider routing + performance profiling

Near-Term Non-Goals:
- Full large-model GPU optimization
- Enterprise auth / multi-tenancy
- Distributed cluster orchestration

Success Signals:
- Can onboard after a 2-week break in <30 minutes using memory docs
- 3 solid blog posts drafted from real implementation artifacts
- Stable SDK API (no breaking changes over a 2-week window)
- Reproducible benchmark script with consistent p95 latency tracking
